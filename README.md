# Evaluation the quality of Fake News Detection

 The spreading of disinformation throughout the web has become a critical problem for a democratic society. The dissemination of fake news has become a profitable business and a common practice among politicians and content producers. A recent study entitled 'Regulating disinformation with artificial intelligence', examines the trade-offs involved in using automated technology to limit the spread of disinformation online. Although AI and Natural Language Generation have evolved so much in the last decade, there are still few shortcomings that must be better understood for a stronger solution. The students will dive deeper into Natural Language Processing; therefore a strong knowledge of Python and AI is necessary. 

 ## Goal
 Understand more explore the vulnerabilities and limitations of automatic fact-checking detection for supporting development of regulations and better technology.
